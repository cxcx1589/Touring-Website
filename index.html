<h1>New York City</h1></br>
</p>New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, and exerts a significant 
impact upon commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, and sports. The city's fast pace 
defines the term New York minute. New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of the State 
of New York. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island &#45; were consolidated into a single 
city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As 
many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. </p>
